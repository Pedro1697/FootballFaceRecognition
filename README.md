In the following data science and machine learning project, we classify 5 fooball players. We restrict classification to only 5 players:
  1. Cristiano Ronaldo
  2. Lionel Messi
  3. Neymar Jr
  4. Kylian Mbappe
  5. Erling Haaland

The structure of the project:
* model: contains python notebook for model building
* image_scrapping: python code for the model building
* server: contains the flask server and UI
* images_dataset: link for the image dataset used for the model training

Technologies used in the project:
* Python
* NumPy and OpenCV for data cleaning
* Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization
* Sklearn for model building
* Jupyter notebook and visual studio code as IDE
* Python flask for http server
* HTML/CSS/Javascrip for UI
